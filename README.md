# Next Interview

**The goal:** This is an opportunity to showcase your problem-solving skills and
knowledge of Next.js in a "real-world" scenario. Start with identifying one or
more issues, prioritize one, and attempt to fix it.

**Time limit:** 20 minutes.

To get started:

- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install`.
- Open the code in your favorite editor or IDE.
- There's some boiler-plate noise, the important files are:
  - `src/pages/index.ts`: the landing page.
  - `src/server/routers/blog.ts`: the backend code.

Helpful commands:

```sh
npm run dev # Run the dev server
npm run build # Build the project
npm start # Run the production build
npm run db:push # Push changes to the database
npm run db:studio # Run Prisma Studio
```

Should you need it, the database schema can be found at `prisma/schema.prisma`.
